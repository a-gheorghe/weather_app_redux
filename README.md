# Redux Weather App

This app was built while doing Stephen Grider's React-Redux course on Udemy. The app allows you to search for any cities in the USA and to display 5 days of temperature, pressure, and humidity in those cities. It uses React, Redux, Sparklines (for graphing), and Google Maps.

### Getting Started
